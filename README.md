# AI-Prey-Predator-Simulation
This Unity project simulates a dynamic predator-prey ecosystem driven by AI behaviors. Prey search for grass and water to survive and reproduce, while predators hunt prey or drink water to stay alive. Both species must manage hunger, thirst, and reproduction, balancing survival against resource competition. The ecosystem evolves with fluctuating populations, resource scarcity, and emergent behaviors like agent communication, danger marking, and collaborative hunting. The simulation showcases the delicate interplay between species, resources, and environment in a constantly shifting struggle for survival.
